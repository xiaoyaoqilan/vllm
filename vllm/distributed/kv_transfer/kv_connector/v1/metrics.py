class KVConnectorStats:

    Base class for KV Connector Stats, a container for transfer performance
    metrics or otherwise important telemetry from the connector.

    All sub-classes need to be serializable as stats are sent from worker to
    logger process.

    **Pipeline overview**

    1. Each worker independently records per-transfer observations into its
       own :class:`KVConnectorStats` instance (e.g. via ``record_transfer``).
    2. Workers ship their raw observations to the logger process.
    3. :meth:`aggregate` concatenates observations from all workers into a
       single combined pool.
    4. :meth:`reduce` computes summary statistics (averages, percentiles,
       throughput) over the combined pool.
    5. :meth:`KVConnectorLogging.log` formats and emits the reduced metrics
       to the log.

    Because the data arrives **pre-aggregated across workers**, the summary
    metrics represent cross-rank aggregates — not per-engine or
    per-transfer totals.  See the connector-specific stats subclass for
    per-metric semantics.

        the last time interval.  The returned dict is keyed by human-readable
